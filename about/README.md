## what is a bookmarklet?

"A bookmarklet is simply some Javascript code. You can execute Javascript code directly from the browser's address bar. Simply type  javascript:  followed by the script code.

Example:

Enter this URL in your browser:
```js
javascript:alert('Bookmarklets!')
````

> **Note**
> Make sure Javascript is enabled in your browser.

You can execute bookmarklets from any web page, either by typing them directly, or by saving them as a bookmark\/favorite and then selecting them.

A bookmarklet has complete access to the current web page. This allows you to change colors, scale fonts, calculate the number of words, etc. Bookmarklets are very powerful this way.

In fact, maybe you already use bookmarklets without knowing it. Search bookmarklets are all the rage these days. The most famous is probably Google\'s version, but all of them work the same way: you select some text on the current page, then call the bookmarklet. A new window will open (or maybe not) and you will be redirected to the search results of the selected word(s)."
